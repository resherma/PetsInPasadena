			<p> Pet’s Delight, a small pet store in South Pasadena is struggling to stay in business because of a new city ordinance to ban the sale of dogs, cats, and rabbits.</p>

			<p> “Of course, we’re barely scratching to get through,” said Brent Anderson, who owns Pet’s Delight located at 725 Fair Oaks Ave. He said it is very unfortunate the way this unfolded for a business that’s been in the city for 40 years.</p>

			<p> Anderson sold pets of all kind, until the recent ordinance set by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) took affect in May 2017. PETA has been petitioning the animal commission of South Pasadena for the last few years, to pass this law.</p>

			<p> Pets are a deep-rooted part of the culture in South Pasadena. The city is a pet driven, animal friendly community where owners walk their pets on any given day.</p>

			<p> Over the decades, Anderson believes he has contributed to his community by selling his neighbors and clients dogs, cats, and other animals. Roughly 40 percent of his dogs were rescued, he said. Now, with this new ordinance in place, Anderson has not been able to sell any of the animals.</p>

			<p> Anderson said the South Pasadena Humane Society promised to provide him pets once he got rid of all of his dogs, cats and rabbits. But, now they refuse to help.</p>

			<p> “The day the ordinance was signed I tried to call and they said no. They said they are not going to help me sell dogs, cats and rabbits because I am selling other animals,” he said. “So, they were disingenuous at best and unfortunately most of the rescue organizations are shady at best."</p>

				<h3>South Pasadena, CA</h3>

				<p> A local ordinance bans the sale of cats, rabbits, and dogs from pet stores </p>

			</div> 

		</div>

	</div>

	<div class="content">

		<div class="firststory">

			<p> The ordinance to ban the sale of dogs, cats and rabbits originally started as a way to stop puppy mills and other animals bred in substandard facilities, said Chief of Police Arthur Miller.</p>

			<p> Chief Miller along with Captain Mike Neff, South Pasadena Police Department, submitted the staff report to the City Council establishing this ordinance.</p>

			<p> “It is staff's opinion that the most direct way to protect the welfare and safety of companion animals is to adopt an ordinance that would prohibit the sale of all commercially bred dogs, cats and rabbits in retail pet stores, retail businesses, or other commercial establishments within South Pasadena,” according to the report.</p>

			<p> Brandon Yung, a local journalist covering the issue, said he believes the new ordinance will be beneficial for the city and for animals.</p>

			<p> “People are still able to purchase animals from certified breeders as well. Pet's Delight, the only pet shop in town that sold bred animals, already sold both bred and kennel animals, so the only downside to the ordinance was a slight economic impact to their business, which I think is vastly outweighed by the ethical impacts of the ordinance,” Yung said.</p>

			<p> In the meantime, Anderson is trying to save his business, which includes changing marketing strategies and cutting costs where he can.</p>

			<p> The South Pasadena Humane Society has a wait list of 10-14 people at any given time, so Pet’s Delight was serving the community to fill the gap between Humane Societies and the internet.</p>

			<p> “When a person wants a pet, they are going to find a way to get it. Unfortunately, now they are stuck going to the internet, black market, etc.” Anderson said. He criticizes this option and believes purchasing pets through the internet can be “nebulous,” not holding the same intention as a storefront.</p>

			<p> One solution, Anderson said, is for human societies to partner with pet shops so that animals find good homes.</p>

			<p> Anderson continues to contact the South Pasadena Humane Society, but they have been refusing to help him sell rescue animals at Pet’s Delight, for the past year.</p>

			<p> “Banning the sale of animals and, more so, making it harder to get animals is not the way to go,” Anderson said.</p>

			<p> He is upset and shocked that the animal commission accepted PETA’s recommendation to the city.</p>

			<p> “For an organization to prefer to euthanize an animal versus finding a home is mind numbing to me,” Anderson said about PETA.</p>

			<p> This ordinance came as a surprise to residents and local business owners of the city, as Anderson said the city was providing very little community notification and was giving residents very little chance to respond.</p>

			<p> “The city council only took note of the animal commissions voice, and the animal commission is somewhat tainted,” Anderson said.</p>

			<p> The Pet’s Delight owner has a petition for residents of South Pasadena to sign at his store.</p>

			<p> “If I can be the voice of the community, even that portion that comes to my store. I feel the personal responsibility to carry that message and make sure that the city council does hear what the community really wants,” he said.</p>

		<p> Another local business owner, Howard Finkelstein, has trained 45,000 dogs in his career since 1956. He runs Obedience Please, a dog training company in the city of South Pasadena.</p>

		<p> “At the age of 80 my primary motivation for continuing is to help make dogs safe in a complex world,” Finkelstein said.</p>

		<p> Finkelstein said the motives of the city council and PETA are noble, but often the results cause more harm, and the unintended consequences can be very detrimental.</p>

		<p> “The city ordinance is hurting the lives of animals in ways that would take educating PETA of certain realities,” he said.</p>

		<p> Bob Likins, Vice President of Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council (PIJAC), said California has adopted a statewide ban on the sale of animals, so the next thing people are likely to see at the local level are bans on more species of pets like Cambridge, MA recently put into place. He said this ban forbids the sale of any types of pets except fish.</p>

		<p> Anderson said we need to be more cognizant as a society to really know what’s happening with our state legislator. He said it is up to us to really research these laws, that are being passed under the radar.</p>

		<p> “Pay attention to what’s going on because it definitely affects you directly,” he said.</p>
